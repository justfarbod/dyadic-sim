"""What the naive lexicons must and must not fire on.

Every case here comes from a real failure. The false-positive cases were found
by reading the evidence CSV a run emits - each firing with the word that matched
and the sentence it came from - and the false-negative cases by checking whether
the frames rejected genuine symptom talk. Both directions matter: an earlier
version suppressed "I don't enjoy things" (the symptom) as though it were
"I'm not depressed" (a denial).
