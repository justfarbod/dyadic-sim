"""Guard the embedding input against silent truncation.

The most consequential bug this project has had. Every session-level embedding
score produced before this test existed was computed on a truncated input:
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` accepts 256 word-piece tokens and a concatenated session
runs many times that, so every one was cut and only its opening reached the
model. Sentence Transformers truncates silently, with no warning and no error,
so nothing in the pipeline could reveal it.

The documentation described this as "dilution" over all ten turns. It was not
dilution. Everything after approximately the opening turn was discarded, and the
measure could not answer whether a symptom appeared later in a session.

These tests exist so that cannot happen again unnoticed. They do not assert that
turn-level is short enough - it often is not, 40% of turns also exceed the limit
- they assert that we know the numbers and that anything claiming whole-text
coverage actually has it.
