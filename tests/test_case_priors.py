"""A case prior must not contain the vocabulary its detectors hunt for.

The patient agent is HANDED the prior and paraphrases it for ten turns, so any
symptom term written into a case propagates into every transcript generated from
it - including the control sessions, where nothing was injected and the base rate
is supposed to be the thing you measure against.

This is not hypothetical. `feeling_off` was written deliberately as the neutral
bed, with a warning in the file itself about a draft that had leaked symptoms,
and it still floods emotional-numbness detectors in 100% of its own controls. The
reason is one phrase in its presenting complaint:

    "I've just felt a bit off for a while, not myself"
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
`not myself` is a literal entry in `depressed_mood`'s `self_framed` list. The bed
seeds the exact string the detector looks for, and every session inherits it.

Thirty seconds of this check would have saved that arm. So it runs on every
commit instead.
