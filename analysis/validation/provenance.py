"""Write a configuration sidecar beside every result artifact.

A result CSV used to record none of the choices that produced
it. Whether text was cleaned, whether the unit was session or turn, single or
expanded references, which aggregation, which model revision, which lexicon —
none of it was stored. Some appeared only in figure titles, which are not
machine-readable provenance, and the embedding model revision was unpinned, so a
rerun could silently produce different numbers under the same filenames.

That matters more here than usual, because several of those choices have been
shown to move results: cleaning shifts `psychomotor_changes` by 0.51, session
versus turn changes the contrast by 0.3, and `max` versus `mean` aggregation
flips it by 0.4. A result without its configuration cannot be compared to
anything.

Hashes rather than copies for the lexicon and references: the point is to detect
that they changed, not to duplicate them, and both live in version control.

Two failures of the first version are fixed
here.

**One filename per script, not one per directory.** `symptom_embed.py` and
`naive_prevalence.py` both wrote `analysis_config.json` into the same output
directory, so the second run silently replaced the first. It cost real evidence
in both directions - one corpus kept only its embedding configuration, another
only its lexicon one - and which survived depended on nothing but run order, so
a headline result can end up with no record of how it was produced. Sidecars
are now named `<script-stem>.analysis_config.json`.

**Fingerprint the inputs, not their count.** The old sidecar recorded
`{"n_sessions": 189}`, which cannot establish *which* sessions produced a number.
`corpus_fingerprint()` now records sorted session IDs and a SHA-256 of each
`metadata.json` and `transcript.jsonl`, plus one aggregate hash over all of them,
so a rerun on a changed or differently-filtered corpus is detectable rather than
merely suspected.

**Two records, answering different questions.** The sidecar answers "how were
the files sitting in this directory produced" and describes only the current
artifacts. `runs.jsonl` beside it is append-only and answers "what has this
directory been" — every run that has written here, including the ones since
replaced.

That split is what lets a results directory be overwritten freely. Writing used
to REFUSE when the incoming configuration was incompatible with the existing
sidecar, because overwriting destroyed the only record of the current artifacts.
The cost was a new directory per fix — `_v2`, `_predfix`, `_final` — names that
stop meaning anything the moment the thing they were distinguished from is
archived, and that leave stale numbers sitting under current-looking names.

Now the superseded configuration is appended to the log *before* it is replaced,
so an overwrite costs the artifacts but not the record, and the refusal is a
printed note instead. This is the right trade while a pipeline is still being
refined and every fix would otherwise fork the directory tree. It is NOT the
right trade for a frozen result: archive that, and the log travels with it.
