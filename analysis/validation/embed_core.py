"""The embedding measure's shared core: references, scoring, and the corpus loop.

Extracted so `symptom_embed.py` and `symptom_embed_robust.py` cannot diverge.
They had, badly: the robustness check concatenated whole sessions and embedded
them directly, which meant it was validating a *truncated opening-only* measure
while claiming to test the turn-level one. A robustness analysis must vary only
its declared dimension - here, the reference wording - and share everything
else.

What lives here is everything both need: how references become one score per
symptom, how a session becomes text units, how units collapse, and what quality
context travels with each row. What stays in the scripts is what genuinely
differs: which reference sets to compare, and how to present the result.

    control and the printed mean averaged those per-session contrasts, while this
    function recomputed a single pooled injected mean minus a single pooled
    control mean. Those are different estimands whenever cases have unequal
    control counts - one case with six controls against another with five is
    enough. The two estimators drifted apart by a margin comparable to the effect
    being reported, which is how the disagreement was noticed.

    The estimand is now declared: **one contrast per case, pooled with equal
    weights.**

    Scope, stated because the implementation cannot support more: only SESSIONS
    are resampled, so the interval is conditional on the cases actually
    observed. It does NOT estimate generalisation to new patient cases, and
    calling cases "the unit of generalisation" would overstate it - power01 has
    a single case and a single model pair, where case-level generalisation is
    not estimable at all. Generalising over cases needs many more of them and a
    case-level resampling or hierarchical model.

    The interval is a bootstrap resampling whole SESSIONS within case and
    condition. Parametric SEs got this wrong twice: sd/sqrt(n) over the contrast
    column treats the control mean as known, and the two-sample form ignores the
    stratified-by-case construction. Resampling the actual sampling unit avoids
    having to derive the right formula for a matched, unbalanced design.
