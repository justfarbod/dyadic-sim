"""Frozen quality-control flags for generated transcripts.

Two data-quality problems that are not analysis bugs
but distort both the lexicon and the embedding if left unmarked:

**Role confusion.** Some generated patient turns are written in therapist
voice - empathic validation followed by clinical questions put to the therapist.
The loaders correctly attribute it to `patient_text`, so structurally it is
patient speech, but semantically it is not patient self-report. Scoring it as
symptom expression measures the generator's role compliance, not the patient's
symptoms.

**Annotation-only turns.** `simulation.utterance.clean_utterance` deliberately
falls back to the original text when cleaning would empty a turn, because at
GENERATION time an empty turn would be written into the transcript and break the
dialogue. The consequence is that `clean=True` can still hand the analysis
"(pauses)" - a turn that is entirely stage direction. That belongs excluded here
rather than fixed there.

Both are reported, never silently applied. Exclusion is a pre-specified analysis
choice, and the rate by condition is itself worth knowing: if role confusion
correlates with condition, it is a confound rather than noise.
