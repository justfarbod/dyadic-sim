Shared session loading for the symptom analyses.

Centralises the logic that was duplicated across symptom_embed.py,
symptom_embed_robust.py and the since-deleted symptom_manifest.py: parsing the
generated case name,
extracting patient text (dropping the verbatim-echo artifact), and iterating
session directories from an arbitrary glob.

`parse_case` handles ANY run prefix, including multi-word ones, not just the
hardcoded "batch_" the original scripts assumed.
