"""Naive symptom prevalence: two panels, PHQ-9 and MADRS.

Answers the plainest possible version of the question. If we asked whether each
PHQ-9 item or MADRS topic shows up in this conversation, using nothing but
vocabulary the patient actually used, how often would we say yes?

Rows are the injected condition, including the `no_symptoms` control. Columns
are the detected symptom. A cell is the fraction of sessions in that condition
where the detector fired. So the **control row is the base rate**, printed in
the same units as everything else, and the **diagonal** is whether injecting a
symptom makes the patient talk about it.

Read the control row first. Some lexicons fire on most sessions regardless of
what was injected, and for those the column carries no information at all - a
broad one like `depressed_mood` can fire in the majority of sessions where
nothing was injected, simply because distress vocabulary is everywhere in a
therapy transcript. Detection only means something where the base rate is low.

Detection is `analysis.validation.lexicon_detect`: patient speech only,
negation-scoped, plus therapist-question-with-referential-answer. Every firing
keeps the word that matched and the sentence it came from; `--evidence` dumps
them so any cell can be audited by hand.

    PYTHONPATH=. python analysis/validation/naive_prevalence.py \
        --sessions 'data/sessions/session_*' --prefix power01 \
        --out-dir data/results/power01

This is the floor, not the measure. Its mean lift over control is small, and
for some symptoms negative - the case narrative produces the symptom whether
or not it was injected. That is a result worth reporting, not a bug to tune
away.
