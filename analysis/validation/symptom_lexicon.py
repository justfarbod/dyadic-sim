"""The naive symptom lexicons, in one place, as word lists.

**This is the file to edit.** Previously the PHQ-9 lexicon lived in
`symptom_manifest.py` (since deleted) and the MADRS one inside
`symptom_scoring/instruments/`,
both as raw regex. Here they are plain word lists; the regex is generated, so
adding a term means adding a word.

Three categories per symptom, because the same word means different things
depending on how it is used:

``self_framed``
    Phrases that already carry both their polarity and their owner, so they can
    fire as written: "kill myself", "no energy", "can't sleep". Still suppressed
    by an outer negation ("I would never kill myself").

``symptom_terms``
    Single words naming the symptom: "insomnia", "depressed", "worthless".
    Fire only inside a **self-attribution frame**, so "I have insomnia", "my
    insomnia", and "I've been diagnosed with insomnia" all count while "my dad
    had insomnia" does not. Suppressed when negated.

``health_terms``
    Words naming the *healthy* state: "interest", "appetite", "energy",
    "concentrate", "sleep". Fire only inside a **decrement frame**, because for
    these the symptom is the absence: "no interest", "lost interest", "trouble
    concentrating", "can't sleep". The frame must PRECEDE the term.

``predicate_health_terms``
    Health terms that are also safe on the other side of a copula, so they get
    the decrement frame in both positions: "poor sleep" AND "my sleep is poor",
    "my sleep hasn't been good". Named for that operational property rather than
    for grammar - `concentrat\\w*`, `focus\\w*` and `interest\\w*` all admit
    verbal and inflected forms, so "is it a noun" is the wrong admission test.

    The admission test is whether the predicate form stays clean. It does not
    for `rest` ("the rest is terrible" is not a sleep complaint) or for the food
    nouns ("dinner was awful" is a restaurant, not appetite loss), so those stay
    in ``health_terms``.

Why the split exists. Most PHQ-9 items are losses, so negating the healthy word
*is* the symptom. A single lexicon with a blanket negation filter gets this
exactly backwards - these are the symptom:

    "I don't enjoy things"          "I can't eat much"

and this is a denial:

    "I'm not depressed"

Suppressing all three identically is why a blanket filter changes nothing.

Why frames rather than bare words. A bare token fires overwhelmingly on the
wrong sense, and the wrong senses are the common ones:

    "down"    "I was walking down the street"
              "(pausing, looking down at hands)"
              "it feels like it's pushing down on me"
              "I let my guard down around dogs"
              ... against "I've been feeling down lately", which is rare

    "weight"  "a weight on my shoulders" - a metaphor for burden, not appetite

The more phrase-shaped an entry is, the cleaner it stays: "no appetite" cannot
mean anything else, while "appetite" alone means whatever surrounds it.

Frames must be **adjacent**, not merely nearby. A proximity window is not enough
- with 25 characters of slack, "feels like it's pushing down on me" and "let my
guard down" both still fire, because a mood word and a frame happen to share a
sentence. Only intensifiers may sit between the frame and the term.

# Metaphors that depression and panic SHARE.
#
# "A weight on my chest" is a good low-mood metaphor in a depressive patient and
# a literal description of chest tightness in a panicking one. The term cannot
# tell which it is; only the surrounding sentence can:
#
#   low mood   "this big, heavy weight on my chest THAT WON'T GO AWAY"
#              "Every day feels heavy, like there's this weight on my chest..."
#              "I wake up and it's like this heavy weight is on my chest"
#   panic      "...weight on my chest, MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE"
#              "a physical weight on my chest, TIGHTENING MY MUSCLES and
#               MAKING MY HEART RACE"
#              "the weight on my chest IS LIFTING"          <- relief, not mood
#              "...when I THINK ABOUT actually doing something about this fear"
#
# The mood reading pairs the metaphor with PERSISTENCE; the panic reading pairs
# it with BREATHING/CARDIAC ACTIVATION, RELIEF, or an anticipatory trigger. That
# is the discriminator, and it is a property of the context rather than of the
# term - the same shape as negation and ownership, so it is handled the same
# way, in `lexicon_detect`.
#
# This matters most on a case whose presenting problem is anxiety, where the
# panic reading is the common one and an unguarded match makes the detector
# report depression every time the patient describes a racing heart.

#
# Not a relabelling of PHQ-9. Four topics differ in substance:
#   Anspannung          inner tension and dread. PHQ-9 has no anxiety item.
#   Antriebslosigkeit   lassitude: difficulty starting and finishing things,
#                       which is not the same as feeling tired.
#   Gefuehlslosigkeit   inability to feel, emotional numbness. Overlaps
#                       lack_of_pleasure but is about absent feeling, not
#                       absent enjoyment.
#   Gedanken            pessimistic thoughts: guilt, self-blame, and a bleak
#                       view of the future, which PHQ-9 splits differently.
