"""Check a corpus against the design it is supposed to instantiate.

`config/designs.yaml` states, prospectively, what each arm should contain. This
module compares that to what is on disk and reports three things separately:

  missing      expected cells with fewer runs than declared
  unexpected   sessions present under a prefix the manifest does not describe
  extra        valid runs beyond `runs`, kept or not according to `inclusion`

The distinction matters. Suppose a cell declared for five runs turns out to hold
six. The objection is not that an extra control biases anything - equal-case
weighting absorbs it - but that if no rule said in advance whether it belonged,
any rule chosen now is chosen with knowledge of its effect.

Silence is the failure mode this guards against: a corpus that quietly grew, or
quietly lost a cell, looks identical to one that did neither.
