"""Naive symptom detection: did the patient actually say it?

The honest floor for the question "would a reader find this symptom in the
transcript". Deliberately transparent, no embeddings and no trained model, so
every firing can be traced to the exact words that caused it.

A plain keyword search is not good enough, and the corpus shows why. Sampling
sentence-level hits from the existing lexicon:

  matched "down"      in "(looking down, fidgeting with hands)"    stage direction
  matched "enjoy"     in "learn how to enjoy the journey"          an aspiration
  matched "nightmare" in "stuck in this never-ending nightmare"    a metaphor
  matched "dying"     in "I could be dying on the inside"          a figure of speech

A quarter of sentence-level hits sit in a sentence containing a negation.
Vocabulary presence answers "was this word used", not "does this person have
this symptom", and the two diverge most where the base rate is already high - a
broad lexicon like `depressed_mood` fires in most sessions where nothing at all
was injected, at which point the column carries no information.

Three rules narrow that gap while staying naive:

1. **Negation scoping.** A cue ("not", "never", "don't") suppresses matches
   later in the same clause. Clause-level rather than sentence-level, so
   "I can't sleep, but I still enjoy my hobbies" negates sleep and not enjoy.
   This removes false firings from control and injected sessions at the same
   rate, so it leaves the lift over control roughly unchanged while making each
   individual firing trustworthy. Kept for auditability, not for sensitivity.
2. **Recurrence is measured but NOT gated.** `min_turns` defaults to 1, i.e.
   off. The intuition (metaphors are one-off, real complaints recur) does not
   survive contact with a 10-turn session, where a patient may say the thing
   once and never return to it. Requiring a second mention discards a genuine
   single complaint - "And sleep? That's been almost impossible lately" - faster
   than it discards a metaphor, and the lift over control falls as the gate
   tightens. The per-turn counts and evidence are still returned, so recurrence
   can be inspected without filtering on it.
3. **Patient speech only**, with one exception: if the therapist raised the
   topic and the patient answered referentially ("yes", "sometimes"), that
   counts, because the patient did confirm it. The confirmation is recorded
   with its own source so it can be excluded or inspected separately.

What it still cannot do is understand meaning. Metaphor and aspiration that
survive the recurrence filter will pass. That is the line where "naive" stops,
and it is the argument for reading this alongside a trained rater rather than
instead of one.
