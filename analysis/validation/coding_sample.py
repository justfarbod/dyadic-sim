"""Draw a blinded, stratified sample for human coding, and seal the key.

Tier D. Every automated number in this project describes an instrument, not a
patient: nothing here has been checked against human judgement. Until that
exists, "the lexicon found 19%" is a statement about the lexicon, and group
separation could equally be a systematic linguistic proxy rather than symptom
expression.

Two samples, because they answer different questions:

  session items  "Reading this whole conversation, does the patient report X?"
                 Tests whether the group separation the instruments report is
                 visible to a person at all.
  turn items     "Is this turn evidence that the patient has X?"
                 Tests the evidence trail directly: precision and recall of the
                 lexicon at the level where it actually fires.

Both are stratified so that the sample cannot flatter the instruments. Coders
see equal numbers of detected and undetected items, injected and control
sessions, and the strata deliberately include role-confused and crisis-paused
sessions rather than quietly excluding the awkward ones.

**Blinding.** The written items carry no condition, case name, session id, run
number or detector verdict, and are shuffled. The key is written to a separate
file that coders must not open. Item ids are opaque digests, so ordering leaks
nothing either.
