"""Load, audit and compare the PHQ-9 exemplar pools.

The pools live in `analysis/validation/exemplars/` and are described by
`GENERATION.md`, which is the provenance record. Two audits run here, both
BEFORE the exemplars are allowed to influence the lexicon:

**Purity.** Every exemplar is embedded and assigned to its nearest domain
centroid. An exemplar written for X but nearest to Y is a candidate leak. The
resulting confusion matrix is not only a quality check on the pool: it measures
how much of PHQ-9's domain structure survives translation to sentence level at
all, which upper-bounds what any detector can achieve. PHQ-9 is a screening and
severity instrument scored by frequency, never validated as a sentence-level
ontology, so some domain overlap is inherent to it — `low_energy` and
`lack_of_pleasure` are not cleanly separable because the instrument never
claimed they were. Read a muddy matrix as a fact about PHQ-9 first and about the
pool second.

Centroids are LEAVE-ONE-OUT: an exemplar does not contribute to the centroid it
is scored against. Including it pulls the centroid toward the point and
flatters the result, the same bias that `target_z_loo` corrects in
symptom_embed.py.

**Overlap.** Nearest-neighbour similarity between pools, in both directions,
because the two directions answer different questions:

    H -> A   is every human exemplar reached by generation?  (recall of human
             intuition; low means the generator has blind spots)
    A -> H   is every generated exemplar something a human wrote?  (novelty; low
             is GOOD, it means generation found phrasings we would not have)
    A -> B   do two independent generation passes cover the same space?
             (saturation; low means 100/domain is too few)

    """Exemplars as multi-reference embedding targets, keyed by PHQ-9 symptom.

    The expanded counterpart to `symptom_scoring.prior_vocabulary.REFERENCES`,
    which holds ONE hand-written sentence per symptom. One sentence turned out to
    be badly under-specified: two independent 100-exemplar samples of the same
    symptom share only about a sixth of their phrasing (see GENERATION.md), so a
    single probe can only ever catch the corner of the space it happens to sit
    in.

    `confounded` exemplars are excluded by default. They carry the symptom's
    vocabulary but are deliberately NOT evidence for it (symptom present, cause
    external), so admitting them as reference targets would make the measure
    fire on precisely the cases it should ignore.

    Lives here rather than in `symptom_scoring` because these are analysis
    artifacts: the prompt vocabulary is generation-side and canonical, this is
    measurement-side and revisable.

    **Pool A only by default, and the reason is not arbitrary.** Aggregation over
    a symptom's references is configurable in `symptom_embed.py`
    (`--reference-agg`, default `mean`). Under `max` a score is biased upward by
    how many references it is taken over; under `mean` set size changes what is
    being averaged. Either way, unequal sets are not comparable across symptoms.
    Pool B covers only three of the nine domains, so including it would give
    those three roughly twice the references and shift their scores for that
    reason alone. Pool A is uniform at 85 per domain; pool B is for measuring
    saturation, not for scoring.

    Any caller passing multiple pools should check the counts stay balanced;
    `_warn_if_unbalanced` does it for you.
