"""Load the frozen analysis specification and evaluate results against it.

`config/analysis_spec.yaml` fixes the parameters, the estimand, the obligatory
sensitivities and what counts as evidence. This module reads it and applies the
criteria, so the verdict on a cell comes from the declared rule rather than from
whichever number looked best.

The criteria are conjunctive on purpose. In power01 `psychomotor_changes` has a
LARGER lexicon lift than `sleep_problems` (+17pp vs +14pp) and should still not
count: it leaks into the sleep arm (+6pp) and the embedding sees nothing
(d=0.11). A magnitude-only rule admits it. That is the whole argument for
requiring magnitude AND specificity AND agreement in direction.
