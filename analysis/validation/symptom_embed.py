"""
Embedding-based manipulation check (robust to lexicon breadth).

For each session we embed the patient's utterances and compare them to short
reference descriptions of each of the 9 PHQ-9 symptoms. The key quantity is a
*within-session* z-score: how much more similar is the patient's speech to the
INJECTED symptom than to the other 8 symptoms, in that same session. Within-
session standardisation controls for case, verbosity, and overall "clinical
tone", isolating the effect of the manipulation itself.

  target_z > 0  -> patient leans toward the injected symptom (manipulation works)
  target_z ~ 0  -> injected symptom is not preferentially expressed

Three variants are written, all per session, none replacing another, so a
result computed under one remains reproducible after another is added:

  target_z             the original. Target against all 9 references including
                       itself.
  target_z_loo         target against the OTHER 8. Including the target in its
                       own reference distribution raises both mu and sd when the
                       target is genuinely elevated, shrinking its own z, so the
                       bias is largest where the effect is largest, which
                       understates the headline in a known direction.
  target_z_vs_control  target_z minus the mean z for that same symptom over the
                       `no_symptoms` sessions of the same case and model. This
                       is the between-session contrast: it asks whether the
                       injection did anything beyond what the case leans toward
                       on its own. Read this one when cases differ in theme.
                       NaN where a case has no control sessions.

Control sessions are kept in the CSV rather than dropped, since the contrast is
computed from them.

`--unit` chooses what gets embedded, and it is a substantive choice, not a
performance knob. Two modes reproduce history and two guarantee coverage:

  session       ⚠ REPRODUCTION ONLY. Concatenates all patient turns into one
                string, which exceeds the model's 256-token limit in every
                session measured, and Sentence Transformers truncates silently.
                The score describes roughly the opening of the session, not the
                session. Retained only to reproduce numbers computed this way
                before the limit was noticed; those numbers are NOT
                whole-session measures. Calling this "dilution" would be
                wrong: later turns are discarded, not averaged.
  turn          ⚠ REPRODUCTION. One unit per turn, each symptom keeping its best,
                recorded in `turn_<symptom>` so a cell can be read back against
                the transcript. Much safer than `session` but not safe: a long
                turn still truncates.
  bounded-turn  As `turn`, but splits only the turns that overflow. The closest
                safe equivalent of historical turn scoring, and the recommended
                default for new work.
  chunk         Sentence-packed chunks over all patient text, ignoring turn
                boundaries.

Over-limit inputs are a hard error in the bounded modes (it would mean the
chunker is broken) and a loud warning in the reproduction modes.

**Coverage statistics are corpus-specific and are measured per run, not
asserted here.** Every run prints how many inputs exceeded the limit. An
earlier version of this docstring quoted median token counts and a retained
percentage as if they were general facts about the method; they were facts
about one corpus, and they were wrong for the next one by a factor of three.
Numbers baked into comments go stale silently, so measure them per run.

`--unit-agg` controls how a session's units collapse to one score. `max` is
historical and asks "was it said anywhere", but a maximum grows with the number
of units, so an arm with longer sessions scores higher for that reason alone.
The units-per-session table is printed for exactly this reason. Averaging the
top k attenuates a real effect rather than removing it, so a contrast that
survives `top2` and `top3` is not the artifact of a single peak unit - and one
that vanishes at `top2` was.

Respecting the token limit does NOT rescue the measure. Against the lexicon as
an independent yardstick, convergent validity is near zero whether the input is
truncated, per turn, or token-bounded - the three barely differ. The truncation
was a real bug; it was not the reason the measure is weak.

CIs and point estimates for `target_z_vs_control` come from `summarise()`, which
is the ONLY estimator any output should use: one contrast per case, pooled with
equal weights, with a bootstrap over whole sessions within case and condition.
Two earlier approaches were wrong - sd/sqrt(n) over the per-session contrast
column treats the control mean as known, and a pooled two-sample SE ignores the
matched-by-case construction. While the table and the figure used different
estimators they disagreed by a margin comparable to the effect being reported.

Usage:
  # the active corpus (default): data/sessions -> data/results/power01
  PYTHONPATH=. python analysis/validation/symptom_embed.py

  # spec-primary configuration, written explicitly:
  PYTHONPATH=. python analysis/validation/symptom_embed.py \
      --prefix power01 --unit bounded-turn --unit-agg max \
      --references expanded --reference-agg mean --clean-text

Outputs (in --out-dir):
  - symptom_embed_long.csv      per-session similarities + target_z
  - fig_symptom_embed.png       target_z by injected symptom x model
