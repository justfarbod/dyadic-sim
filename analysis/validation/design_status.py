"""Which design cells have been run, at what n, and what is missing.

Derived from the sessions on disk rather than a hand-maintained ledger, so it
cannot drift out of sync with reality. A cell is (prefix, case, symptom); n is
the number of sessions in it.

    PYTHONPATH=. python analysis/validation/design_status.py --prefix power01

Top up a short cell by continuing the run numbering rather than restarting it:

    ... --prefix power01 --case afraid_of_dogs --symptoms sleep_problems \\
        --repeats 5 --start-run 6

Sessions are counted, not run numbers: a crashed batch that left run_3 twice
still reports the true session count. `next run` is the number to pass to
--start-run, one past the highest run number seen, so a top-up never collides
even when numbering has gaps.
