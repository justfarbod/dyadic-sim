"""Canonical input/output locations.

Layout. The primary split is raw vs derived; local vs external applies to raw:

  data/
  ├── sessions/                     RAW, generated on this machine
  │   └── session_*/
  ├── external/                     RAW, imported from elsewhere (read-only)
  │   ├── MANIFEST.yaml             origin + fingerprint per batch
  │   ├── _archives/                the zips the batches were extracted from
  │   └── <dir>/session_*/          one flat dir per batch
  ├── results/                      DERIVED, everything computed here
  │   └── <experiment>/
  └── _archive/                     bulky material kept but not in active use

Every raw session sits at exactly one level below its bucket, so one glob shape
reads any batch.

`EXTERNAL_SETS` is keyed by the manifest's `model` label, not by directory name:
those keys become the `model` column in the output CSVs, so they must stay
stable even if a directory is renamed.
