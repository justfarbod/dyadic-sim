"""Simulation package.

Exports are resolved lazily. `simulation.dyad` imports `priors`, and the priors
import `simulation.utterance` for the shared speech-only instruction, so an
eager re-export here would make that a circular import: loading `priors` would
trigger this module, which would load `dyad`, which needs `priors` back before
it has finished initialising.
