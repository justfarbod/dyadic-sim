"""Reduce a generated turn to spoken language only.

Local models narrate: roughly one sixth of the characters in llama transcripts
are stage directions, such as "(pauses, looking down)" or "*I lean forward
slightly*", and mistral occasionally leaks a role label ("Patient:") into its
own reply.

That noise is not cosmetic. Annotation is unevenly distributed across models
(llama ~16% of characters, mistral ~0.6%), so any cross-model comparison partly
compares narration style, and gesture words feed straight into the
embedding/severity measures that are supposed to read *speech*.

Prompts ask for clean speech (see the priors), but models comply unreliably, so
this runs on every recorded turn as well. `simulation/dyad.py` keeps the
original in `*_text_raw` whenever cleaning changed anything, so nothing is lost.

Scope check before writing this: across 200 local sessions, every parenthetical
found was a stage direction, including first-person ones ("I lean forward
slightly") and non-gestural ones ("walking you out of the office"). No genuine
spoken aside appeared, so removing all of them is safe.

#      No speech-only instruction, no output cleaning. Stage directions in 73%
#      of llama turns, wrapping quotes in 77.5% of mistral patient turns; both
#      artifacts are model-dependent and contaminate cross-model comparison.
#      See VALIDATION.md finding 6. Treat as PILOT data.
#   2  Speech-only instruction in both priors + clean_utterance() on every
#      recorded turn (stage directions, emphasis spans, role labels, wrapping
#      quotes, reasoning blocks), with pre-cleaning text preserved in *_text_raw.
#   3  Therapist opens with speech instead of a stage direction; see
#      simulation/opening.py. The old text instructed the patient to state the
#      presenting complaint, which templated turn 1; the new one invites a broad
#      answer without naming any symptom domain.
#   4  The generator is reduced to priors + cases + symptoms. Removed: the
#      hidden "unconscious agenda" (a second, uncontrolled source of patient
#      material, revealed mid-session on a keyword trigger), the hazard monitor
#      (already observe-only; its substring matcher only ever produced false
#      positives), and per-turn LLM state compression (an agent-written
#      "state summary" injected into every system prompt, doubling the calls
#      per turn and shifting what the patient said for reasons unrelated to
#      the injected symptom). The system prompt is now the prior alone and the
#      context is the transcript alone. Transcript rows lose
#      `unconscious_revealed` and `hazard_flags`; metadata loses
#      `hazard_monitor` and `hazard_summary`; no state snapshots are written.
#      Sessions from earlier versions still load (unknown fields are ignored),
#      but base rates measured on them do not carry over: treat the first v4
#      batch as a new pilot.

# surface implicitly, that is a direct threat to construct validity.

# said "a bit more tired than usual, nothing dramatic" and the therapist asked

# asking a question premised on the upgrade. Prohibiting invented facts was not
# enough, because amplifying a stated one contaminates the measure the same way.
