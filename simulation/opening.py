"""How a session opens: the therapist's first words.

The dyad already treats the opening as a therapist utterance: `dyad.run()` sets
`latest_therapist = opening_utterance(...)` when there is no history, so the
patient's first turn is a reply to it. Until generation_version 3 the text was a
stage direction ("Say what brings you here"), not speech.

Why that mattered: it is literally an instruction to state the presenting
complaint, so it forced complaint-first structure into turn 1. Measured on 50
matched `afraid_of_dogs` sessions, patient turns were far more homogeneous at
turn 1 (mean pairwise cosine 0.724) than at turn 3 (0.583) or turn 5 (0.549),
and openings shared a visible "glad/nervous to be here" formula. That fights a
design in which symptoms are meant to surface as lived texture the patient
raises themselves, rather than as a recited chief complaint.

Two constraints on the wording, both deliberate:

* **Never name a symptom domain.** The opening is the cheapest available version
  of a semi-structured intake, so a broad invitation gets some of the benefit for
  free. But "how have you been sleeping?" would leak the manipulation outright.
  Invite the patient to speak broadly; let them choose what is salient.
* **Explain the prior contact.** Referring to the booking call is why the
  therapist can ask for it "in your own words" without implausibly knowing
  nothing, and it licenses a discursive answer rather than a prepared statement.

    not hit that, which is why only session 1 exists here.
